LeetCode Jump Game II

Problem from LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-ii/

Description:
You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at nums[0].
Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i.
In other words, if you are at nums[i], you can jump to any nums[i + j] where:
- 0 <= j <= nums[i] and
- i + j < n

Return the minimum number of jumps to reach nums[n - 1]. The test cases are generated such that you can reach nums[n - 1].

Example 1:
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [2,3,0,1,4]
Output: 2
